    <h2>Competition 101</h2>

    <p>The logistics of this competition are very simple. Here is a miniature version of this competition:</b> <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/furonghuang-lab/Erasing-Invisible-Demo", target="_blank">Demo</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Input:</strong> A folder of images with invisible watermarks. In the Black-box Track, no additional information is provided. In the Beige-box Track, details about the watermarking techniques used are also included.</li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> Your task is to develop attacks to remove the watermarks while preserving the quality of the images. Submissions will be in the form of a folder of images after attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Submissions will be assessed based on their effectiveness of the watermark removal and the preservation of image quality, resulting in a final composite score.</li>
    </ul>

    We encourage participants to read <b><a href="https://wavesbench.github.io/" target="_blank"> WAVES</a></b> paper to find more details regarding the watermarking algorithms and their evaluation.
    In this paper, you can also find <b>baseline attacks</b>.

    <h2>Warm-up Phase (Finished)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Warm-up Kit:</b> <a href="https://github.com/erasinginvisible/warm-up-kit/tree/main", target="_blank">Github link</a></li>
    </ul>
    This is a preparation phase. No submissions are required.
    The warm-up kit provides example watermarked images and various metrics for evaluating attack potency and image quality.
    It will help you become familiar with the competition pipeline and prepare your attacks.
    <br><br>
    <b>Note</b>: The models, watermarks, images provided in the Warm-up Kit are for practice only. The submission phase will use different ones.
    The final evaluation metric in the submission phase will be based on the metrics provided in the Warm-up Kit.


    <h2>Submission Phase (Ongoing)</h2>
    This is the primary competition phase. The competition is hosted on Codabench.
    There are two tracks (see <a href="tracks.html">Tracks</a> for details), and you can participate in both. Please follow the guidelines and submit your results on Codabench.
    Here are the two tracks on Codabench:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Black Box Track:</b> <a href="https://www.codabench.org/competitions/3857/", target="_blank">Codabench link</a></li>
        <li><b>Beige Box Track:</b> <a href="https://www.codabench.org/competitions/3821/", target="_blank">Codabench link</a></li>
    </ul>
